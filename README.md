# mapinfo-toolkit-matlab
a toolkit for mapinfo, which is write in matlab language.

The first purpose is to transform file like meta data structure to Mif and Mid file.

The primary purpose is that I need to demonstrate a water supply network in MapInfo. and there is not any good way to generate lines in MapInfo. I searched in gitHub, and can not find a easily way because they are used some other language. But I am only familiar with MATLAB. So I think it is time to do it by myself. I hope this can help someone like me who is familiar with MATLAB and needs to show something in MapInfo.

## ACKNOWLEDGE

I want to show my acknowledgement to my mentor, professor Ma, who shows me the way to edit Mif and Mid files. His guidance is like a light in the dark.

## Mif and Mid file
Mif = MapInfo interchange Format(text file format)
